# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Sreeram Venkitesh

### Day 0: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 out of 6 problems in the SDS Coder Hunt Challenge

**Thoughts:** Competetive programming was something I always wanted to improve and add to my skills. 

### Day 1: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fiddled with lists and the zip( ) function in python. 

**Thoughts:** zip( ) function inside a loop can create nested lists which are kinda annoying to work with.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched 3blue1brown's video on neural networks

**Thoughts:** Was tired after the exam. Couldn't code the day before too.

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of lists and nested lists

**Thoughts:** Wrote a function to convert nested lists to flat ones. Donno if it'll work in every combination of nested lists.

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on android app, and also spent some time practicing competetive programming.

**Thoughts:** Realised that you can input a string in python freely, even if it contains special characters, but in Java's Scanner object, the special characters are not being read.

### Day 5: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the android app. Added the select feature, without causing any conflicts with other functions.

**Thoughts:** No problem is un-solvable if you think hard enough. :)

### Day 6: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sprint on the android app, coded a bunch of functions. Delete button on select, About Activity, and a few design changes.

**Thoughts:** Spent some good time coding today! Also, realised that the "cannot resolve symbol R" error occurs in android when there is an error in any of the layout files.

### Day 7 : 9 January, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a tour for first time users.

### Day 8 : 10 January, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the tour.

### Day 9 : 15 January, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the tour.

**Thoughts:**  Couldn't code/log for a few days due to finals. Exams are over hopefully and I can now spend more time learning!
